# Twuiq_four_weeks_T5
This project aims to classify music genre using Machine Learning classifires. These classifications have the capacity to significantly improve our knowledge, recognition, and pleasure of the music we hear when utilized flexibly and descriptively. Music categorization makes it easier for us to find music that suits our tastes, as well as for artists to sell their music in a way that distinguishes them from the competition. For more information about the project's details and dataset see the [project proposal](https://github.com/nora-s-m-kh/Twuiq_four_weeks_T5/blob/main/Music%20genre%20classification%20proposal.pdf).
You can also run the [code](https://github.com/nora-s-m-kh/Twuiq_four_weeks_T5/blob/main/Music_Genre_Classification.ipynb) by downloading the notebook into you machine and upload it to a Jupyter notebook. 


## **Note:**
You should download the dataset to your machine before running the code. You can get access to the dataset through this repo from [here](https://github.com/nora-s-m-kh/Twuiq_four_weeks_T5/blob/main/train.csv) or download it from its publisher [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/purumalgi/music-genre-classification?select=submission.csv)
